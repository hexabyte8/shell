// Desktop themes: one coordinated look across the rice, still coloured by
// the wallpaper. A theme touches three layers:
//   - Hyprland: corner rounding, a glow on the focused window, optional
//     window borders, and an optional static screen shader
//     (shaders/<id>_screen.frag.in, baked with the current colours). Applied
//     at runtime with `hyprctl eval`; switching themes or turning them off
//     runs `hyprctl reload` first, which restores the config exactly.
//   - the desktop: a static layer drawn over the wallpaper
//     (modules/desktoptheme, one <Name>Layer.qml per theme); desktop widgets
//     restyle themselves too (modules/desktopwidgets/WidgetStyle)
//   - shell UI: bar primitives take their shape and type from `look`.
// Nothing here animates continuously, so an idle desktop costs nothing extra.
//
// Only the main shell sets `manage`; other instances (the lock screen) just
// read the choice, e.g. `lockTheme` to match the lock to the desktop.
